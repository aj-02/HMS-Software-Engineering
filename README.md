## Introduction

MediSync is an innovative solution aimed at streamlining healthcare management by providing users with a centralized platform for storing and accessing their medical records. This software is designed to cater to the needs of individuals in India, allowing them to conveniently manage their medical history through a user-friendly interface accessible via web browsers.

### Problem Statement

Managing medical records is often complicated and time-consuming for both patients and doctors. The existing system lacks a unified platform, resulting in inefficiencies and potential security risks. Introducing "MediSync: A Modern Health Interface", where our team addresses this issue by creating a user-friendly web application. MediSync aims to centralize patients' medical histories, providing easy access for individuals and doctors. The system includes features like secure login to ensure data security. With an emphasis on simplicity and convenience, MediSync transforms healthcare by streamlining record management and facilitating collaboration between patients and healthcare providers. 

## Background Research

Research was conducted to understand the existing healthcare management systems and identify the key pain points faced by both patients and healthcare providers. This research revealed the need for a centralized platform that allows users to securely store and access their medical records remotely. Additionally, it highlighted the importance of implementing robust security measures to protect sensitive patient information.

## Proposed System

**MediSync consists of two different sub-systems working together coherently: a website for users and doctors, and an admin management software.**

**This product helps patients to see their medical history from wherever they are and whenever they want.**

**This product helps doctors to check the patients' history and add anything they write on the old doctor’s slips.**

**This system uses cloud database, hence will require only minimal space in the devices running our product.**

**The radiology department will directly upload the results of medical tests as soon as they get it in the form of Text files or PNGs.**

### Goals and Objectives
